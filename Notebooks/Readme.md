We have revised the notebooks with minor changes according to the revised manuscript.
Three revised notebooks are:
- Simulating_neutrino_oscillations_in_vacuum-ver2.ipynb: comment with revised Eq. with global phases $\Lambda(L/E)$.
- Simulating_neutrino_in_matter_ver2.ipynb: comment with revised Eq. with global phases $\Lambda(L/E)$.
- Simulating_neutrino_oscillations_with_CP_violation_ver2: comment with revised Eq. with global phases $\Lambda(L/E)$, update pulse schedule with the cell that was executed to obtain Figure 5
  
We add a notebook to double check the pulse schedule that yields Figure 5:
- Check_phase_input_Figure5.ipynb

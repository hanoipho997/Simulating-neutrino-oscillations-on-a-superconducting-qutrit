We revised the notebooks with minor changes according to the revised manuscript.
Three revised notebooks are:
- Simulating_neutrino_oscillations_in_vacuum-ver2.ipynb: comment with revised Eq.
- Simulating_neutrino_in_matter_ver2.ipynb: comment with revised Eq.
- Simulating_neutrino_oscillations_with_CP_violation_ver2: comment with revised Eq., update pulse schedule with the cell that run Figure 5
  
We update the comments true equations to including global phases $\Lambda(L/E)$. 
We add a notebook to double check the pulse schedule that run Figure 5 from rawdata's input
- Check_phase_input_Figure5.ipynb

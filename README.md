## Code run on IBM quantum computers: 
# Pulse calibration:
- Readout qutrit: The file Frequency and Rabi 12.ipynb yields the anharmonicty and pi pulse at subspace 12
 The default IBM default qutrit readout is shown. 
Measurement pulse optimization:
The measurement protocol optimization is shown in Readout_measurement_optimization_for_qutrit where the silhouette map is shown

# Neutrino oscillation simulation notebooks
- Neutrino oscillations in vacuum (Figure 3)
- Neutrino oscillation in matter (Figure 4)
- Neutrino oscillation with CP violation (Figure 5)
## Data: in Simulating_neutrino_oscillation_superconducting_qutrit_data folder
Corresponding date files to section 1 

- Data for coherent and incoherent errors is (by repetition experiement) is fig2e_repeat_xp12_addmod.txt
